                        Goal: I don't really have any long term goals that are set in stone. Honestly, I just really enjoy my major and
                              would like to continue down that career path in the future. Since I started computer engineering I've realized
                              that it's the perfect fit for me. It is a nice balance between electrical engineering and computer science. I
                              am looking forward to working on engineering and computer science projects in the future and working with people
                              who also enjoy it..<br>

                      Goal: Hey! Being a Vietnamese-American, I acknowledge my birthright to be able to thrive off the opportunities the
                            United States has to offer. I am also fortunate enough to live in a country where leaders in engineering are
                            combating global warming by developing dependable clean energy and energy-efficient technologies. Unlike the
                            United States, Vietnam needs more leaders in this field. The main problem is their unsustainably designed buildings.
                            It takes more electricity to produce the same amount of work as their neighboring countries like China which, ironically,
                            has more infrastructure. I am pursuing this field to contribute to solving the world’s biggest challenge,
                            starting with Vietnam. <br>

                            Major: Biology.
                            Since I studied at Chabot, I have seen the great opportunities and adventures awaiting everywhere for every student. I hope you,
                            the current and future Gladiators, could witness this too. As you meet and talk to your kindhearted professors, staff, counselors,
                            friends, and the successful graduates who transferred to excellent universities, you will develop the faith of turning impossibilities
                            into possibilities. Experiences at Chabot have broadened my horizons and supported me to prepare for my long-term goal of becoming a physician.
                            Equally important, I would love to spend more time getting involved in charity work as well as volunteering for healthcare projects both in
                            the U.S and in Vietnam during the breaks.  <br>

                    played a huge factorial in my life. In my many years of existence, I have yet to figure out my main purpose in life; until recently,
                    as January 2018, when I participating in a coding Bootcamp, 42 Silicon Valley; I soon realize, I really enjoy developing applications,
                    programs, and website. I have played saxophone for almost 10 years of my life, and currently the lead saxophone player for Chabot College
                    Jazz orchestra. Throughout my entire music life, I have played with legendary multi-award musicians such as, Fransisco Torres, Jaime Davis,
